  "description": "Proposes Minimum Spanning Argument (MSA), a novel argumentation framework based on graph theory. MSA ensures unique interpretation by all readers through five axioms: completeness, minimality, acyclicity, ordering, and uniqueness. Validated through case studies in linguistics, narrative analysis, and mathematics. Applications include academic writing, technical documentation, and AI text evaluation.",
